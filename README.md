# Politeiagui restructure POC

**This is just a POC and most likely will change during design phase.**

## Requirements

* Node v14.16.1
* Yarn v1.22.0
* Politeia instance running

## Development

* Clone this repo
* `yarn install` in the root
* `cd packages/app-proposals && yarn start`
* Go to `https://localhost:1234`

## Problems with the current structure:

1. It aggregates everything state related to a unique state tree. Not ideal for the composable plugin structure we are aiming to accomplish.

2. Our state tree is too crowded because we have to store loading and response statuses in the redux store. See this simple loading of proposals in discussion on Politeia:

3. Data fetching in redux is very verbose, right now to do a simple fetch we need to create:
    * Two actions (REQUEST and RECEIVE)
    * One reducer handling both actions
    * One middleware (redux-thunk)

We are doing all this for one thing: **transport backend data and cache it in the client state**.

In this POC I am using [react-query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query) to do the above. It's a lib to deal with backend agnostic data fetching with auto caching. With it we can eliminate *a lot* of boilerplate

4. Our current folder structure looks like this:

```
ğŸ“¦src
 â”£ ğŸ“‚actions
 â”£ ğŸ“‚apps
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚cms
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œconfig.json
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“‚politeia
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œconfig.json
 â”£ ğŸ“‚components
 â”£ ğŸ“‚containers
 â”£ ğŸ“‚hooks
 â”£ ğŸ“‚lib
 â”£ ğŸ“‚pages
 â”£ ğŸ“‚reducers
 â”£ ğŸ“‚selectors
 â”£ ğŸ“‚validators
 â”£ ğŸ“œApp.js
 ğŸ“œpackage.json
 ğŸ“œindex.js
 ...
```

This structure is a good one but is not ideal for a plugin system because you have to touch a lot of places in order to implement a feature. Also, it's not ideal to build and test new plugins in isolation.

### Suggested structure ###

The folder structure in this POC uses [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/) to make it easier to build and test plugins in isolation. See:

```
ğŸ“¦packages
 â”£ ğŸ“‚app-proposals
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚src
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚components
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œApp.js
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œindex.html
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œindex.js
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œstyles.css
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œpackage.json
 â”£ ğŸ“‚plugin-records
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚src
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚components
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚hooks
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œexample.js
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œindex.html
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œindex.js
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œpackage.json
 â”£ ğŸ“‚plugin-ticketvote
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚src
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚components
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚hooks
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œexample.js
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œindex.html
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œindex.js
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œpackage.json
 â”— ğŸ“‚shared
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œpackage.json
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œpki.js
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œuseApi.js
 ğŸ“œindex.js
 ğŸ“œpackage.json
 ```

 With this structure we can build and test plugins in isolation. Every plugin is a package and we have the `shared` folder (also a package) where the reusable code lives.

#### App-proposals

This is the main app that will compose all plugins and extra UI elements.

Notice it has `plugin-records` as a dependency and it uses the `Records` component exported from it.

#### Plugin-records

This is the records plugin. This one will deal with everything related to records.

Notice it has `plugin-ticketvote` as a dependency and it uses the `useInventory` component exported from it. This plugin is exporting the `Records` component and also the `useRecords` hook.

#### Plugin-ticketvote

Similar to the `plugin-records` but it doesn't depend on any other plugin, only uses the `useApi` hook from the shared folder.

## TODO

- [ ] Setup tests
